In your own words, describe the pros and cons of using binary search trees to organize data.  

The pros are the time complexity  of insert, delete, and search is logarithmic. That is very inportant when there are a lot of nodes.

Traversal is always the straightforward and predictable because of the ordering of nodes.

We can look at the BST as an array, so finding the smallest and largest element is easy.

The disadvantage is that the tree can be linear and it can be hard to implement a balanced tree.

*Something I noticed during the cap 31 runs is that the comparisons for unsorted is so high.
